CONFIGURE THE SECRET KEY
The JWT needs a secret key to sign the token this secret key must be unique and never revealed.

To add the secret key edit your wp-config.php file and add a new constant called JWT_AUTH_SECRET_KEY

You can use a string from here https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/
